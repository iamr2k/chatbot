Project descriptionBusiness Objective:
An e-commerce company wants to build an
algorithm to retrieve top 5 Question and
answers based on the user given user input.

Solution :
The input given by the user is first cleaned and features extracted using 3 different algorithms. LSTM Deep Learning classifier will first identify the type of user question (Yes/No ,Open-ended , etc.) The second algorithm Gensim model will identify the 'Product' from the user user input , and the final K-means clustering algorithm will find the cluster in which the user input will fall . This three predictions are embedded to the user input and fed into Cosine similarity algorithm to find similar questions from the Tfidf vector space.
